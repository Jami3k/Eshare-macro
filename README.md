# Eshare-macro
A simple macro to brute-force Eshare-codes. Given a target ip, the script opens Eshare and starts brute-forcing the access code. You can stop it by right-clicking. Since Eshare crashes after about a thousands attempts per session, this script also has the capability to recognize this, re-open Eshare and continue where it last stopped. 
Now also comes with Espeak-support.
